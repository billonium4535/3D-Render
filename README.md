# 3D-Render

This is a simple program that renders a rotating 3D cube using the Pygame library in Python. The cube can be controlled using keyboard inputs to move it and rotate it in different directions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the source code files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.
3. Run the following command to start the program:

   ```
   python cube_renderer.py
   ```

4. The program window will open, and you will see a 3D cube rotating on the screen.
5. Use the following keyboard controls to interact with the cube:

   - **Left arrow key**: Move the cube to the left.
   - **Right arrow key**: Move the cube to the right.
   - **Up arrow key**: Move the cube up.
   - **Down arrow key**: Move the cube down.
   - **W key**: Rotate the cube upwards.
   - **S key**: Rotate the cube downwards.
   - **A key**: Rotate the cube to the left.
   - **D key**: Rotate the cube to the right.

6. Press the close button or the **Esc** key to exit the program.

## Customization

You can modify the code to customize the cube's initial position, size, rotation angles, and other properties. The cube's vertices and edges are defined in the code, allowing you to create different shapes if desired.
